title: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)?

In this post I will try to explain what is SVD and what is it good for, with the help of examples. Just as we can write a non-prime number such as 42 as a product of its factors (e.g. as 6\*7 or as 2\*3\*7), we can use SVD to write _any_ matrix as a product of three matrices. **Why do we need to factorize a matrix? How can we interpret the factors provided by SVD?** These are the questions I will attempt to answer.

## Terminology
Let A be a matrix of size (m,n), i.e. it has m rows and n columns. SVD factorizes A into three matrics:

$$
A = U_{mxr}D_{nxn}V^T_{rxn}
$$

Each of these three matrices have some interesting properties, which we will explore below.

## Preliminaries
It is useful to view our mxn matrix A as a collection of m points located in an n-dimensional space. For example, the matrix below gives us the location of 4 points in 3D space:

$$
A = 
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
2 & 3 & 2 \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 2 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$

If we use the [Cartesian Coordinate System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Three_dimensions), we can describe each point by three numbers, one for each of the x, y, and z axes. Looking at this in another way, we can describe the point (1, 2, 3) as a linear combination of three vectors, each of which represents one of x, y, and z axes:

$$
(1, 2, 3) = 1*\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{pmatrix} + 2*\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{pmatrix} + 3*\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ \end{pmatrix} 
$$

Two other properties of these three vectors are that (1) each of these has unit length, and (2) they are pairwise perpendicular. We can represent any triplet in $R^3$ as a linear combination of these three vectors, and they are collectively said to form an **Orthonormal Basis** of $R^3$. Note that this Orthonormal Basis is not unique - multiply one of the Basis vectors by negative one, and the resulting Basis is still Orthonormal.

**SVD will give us a "Best Fit" Orthonormal Basis for our collection of points. In what sense is it 'Best'? If we project our points on each of the Basis vectors given by SVD, the sum of squared lengths of those projections will be the maximum for any such Orthonormal Basis that exists.**

## Singular Vectors (The V Matrix)
The 'Best Fit' Orthonormal Basis described above is given by the columns of matrix V. Further, there exists a heirarchy among those Basis vectors, with the first column of V, call it V1, being the **First Singular Vector** - a vector which represents the line through origin which 'Best Fits' our collection of points. The second column, V2, being the vector perpendicular to V1, which 'Best Fits' our points, and so on.

Let us visualize it with the help of an example in 2D.
