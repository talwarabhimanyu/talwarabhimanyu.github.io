Yes, this is yet another blogpost on the internet about solving a system of linear equations. My aim here is to capture all possible cases that arise in this problem (skinny, fat, or square matrices; full rank or not; approximate or exact solution; no, unique or many solutions), so that when in doubt (about linear equations), I can revisit this post and get my answers. First and foremost, my references:

1. Prof. Gilbert Strang's course on [Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/)
2. Prof. Stephen Boyd's course [Introduction to Linear Dynamical Systems](https://ee263.stanford.edu/archive/)
