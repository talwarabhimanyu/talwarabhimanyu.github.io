title: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)?

In this post I will try to explain what is SVD and what is it good for, with the help of examples. Just as we can write a non-prime number such as 42 as a product of its factors (e.g. as 6*7 or as 2*3*7), we can use SVD to write _any_ matrix as a product of three matrices. Why do we need to factorize a matrix? How can we interpret the factorization provided by SVD?
