			<h2>Toronto, Canada (2020-Present)</h2>
			<p>I am now based in Toronto and I have created www.quickfin.ai,  where users ask questions in plain English to search 12k+ SEC filings for information, e.g. "show me google sales 2016-2019" or "why did nvidia's r&d change in 1q-2q19?"</p>

			<h2>Cambridge, USA (2018-2019)</h2>
			<p>I quit industry in 2018 to become a full-time Masters student in Harvard University's Data Science program. Two of my interesting projects use Deep Learning to:

 • Reconstruct a 3D scene from multiple sketches

 • Translate Nepali to English using Hindi as a pivot language



 During Spring 2019, I worked with the Visual Computing Group in the area of Shape Analysis for the exciting field of Connectomics. Our work was accepted in Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition Workshops 2020.</p>
