                                                <p>After eight years in Finance, I followed my interest in Machine Learning and in 2018 I joined Harvard University's Master's Data Science program as a full-time student. During Spring 2019, I worked with the Visual Computing Group in the area of Shape Analysis for the exciting field of Connectomics. Our <a href="https://vcg.seas.harvard.edu/publications/a-topological-nomenclature-for-3d-shape-analysis-in-connectomics">work</a> was accepted in Computer Vision & Pattern Recognition Workshops 2020.</p>

						<p>I worked in these gorgeous cities as an investor in debt securities. Most recently I was a Vice President at BlackRock where I was investing in Private Debt of Indian companies. Prior to that, I was a research analyst with the bonds/loans trading desks at Nomura. I had some fabulous mentors during this period to whom I'll be eternally grateful.</p> 

						<p>My stint in Finance afforded me visits to one of world's largest iron ore mines, a sheep farm the size of Singapore, and an integrated steel mill, along with travel to various cities in Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India, as a part of my job!</p>
